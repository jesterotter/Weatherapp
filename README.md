# FOCUS
This project is about building a weather app using vanilla javascript.

## Motivation
This project was inspired by the weather application commonly used. I saw it as an interesting beginner project to play around with some JS.

## Tech/Framework used
I used **basic HTML, CSS & Javascript** to bring this to life. The project also uses the **OpenWeather API** for data and abit of React.

## Credits
A huge thanks to **@developedbyEd**  who provided a comprehensive tutorial for the project using the DarkskyAPI that provided me with a guideline on how to work with APIs.
